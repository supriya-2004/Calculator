# Calculator
## Project Overview
#### This project involves designing and implementing a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes additional functionality to toggle between positive and negative values and a clear button to reset the calculations. The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly and responsive interface while reinforcing basic JavaScript concepts.

## Features
#### Basic Arithmetic Operations:
#### ~ Addition (`+`)
#### ~ Subtraction (`-`)
#### ~ Multiplication (`ร`)
#### ~ Division (`รท`)
#### Utility Buttons:
#### ~ Clear Button: Resets the calculator's display to its initial state.
#### ~ Positive/Negative Toggle Button: Converts a number between positive and negative.
#### Dynamic Output:
#### ~ Real-time updates to the display based on user inputs.
#### ~ User-Friendly Design:
#### ~ Clear and intuitive layout with responsive buttons.

## Structure
#### The project follows a straightforward file structure:
#### index.html: Defines the calculator's structure, including the input display and buttons for numbers and operations.
#### style.css: Provides the styling for the calculator's layout, colors, and button design.
#### script.js: Contains the JavaScript logic to handle calculations, events, and DOM interactions.

## Technologies Used
#### HTML: Used to create the calculator's structure, including the display screen and buttons.
#### CSS: Used for styling the calculator, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
#### JavaScript: Used to implement functionality, including:
#### ~ Capturing user input via event listeners.
#### ~ Performing calculations.
#### ~ Manipulating the DOM to dynamically update the display.

## Learning Outcomes
#### 1. Gained hands-on experience with JavaScript for handling events and calculations.
#### 2. Improved skills in integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive applications.
#### 3. Enhanced problem-solving and debugging abilities in web development.
